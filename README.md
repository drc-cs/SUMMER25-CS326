# Welcome to CS326

This course aims to cover data science theory and tools for obtaining, cleaning, visualizing, modeling, and interpreting data. Most of the tools introduced in this course will be based on Python, although the theory can be applied to any programming language. Ethical data science will be consistently reinforced. As an outcome of this course, students should be able to independently derive insights from real-life datasets.

## GitHub Repository

All course materials, including lecture notes, homework assignments, and exam reviews, will be available on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/drc-cs/summer25-cs326/).

## Attendance

Attendance is mandatory for CS 326 and is worth 10% of your final grade. Most lectures will have interactive quizzes throughout the lecture that will be graded for completion.

------

## Homework

Homeworks are designed to reinforce the concepts covered in lecture. They will be a mix of theoretical and practical problems, and each will include a programmatic and free response portion. If there is time, we will work on homework at the end of every lecture as a group. For the automated grading server, you get 2 attempts per homework assignment. The highest score will be recorded.

- **Due**: Homework due dates are posted in the syllabus.

- **Late Policy**: Late homeworks will lose 1 out of 10 points per day (1% of your final grade).

- **Platform**: A submission script has been provided to submit your homeworks.

- **Collaboration**: You are encouraged to work with your peers on homeworks. However, you must submit your own work. Copying and pasting code from other sources will be detected and penalized.

| Homework | Due Date | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H1 | 06.23.2025 | Hello, World! |
| H2 | 06.25.2025| Exploratory Data Analysis & Hypothesis Testing |
| H3 | 06.27.2025 | Supervised Machine Learning |
| H4 | 07.01.2025 | Unsupervised Machine Learning |
| H5 | 07.03.2025 | Time Series |

## Exams

There are two exams in this class. They will cover the theoretical and practical concepts covered in the lectures and homeworks. If you follow along with the lectures and homeworks, you will be well-prepared for the exams.
